	<h3 style="font-family: 'Roboto Condensed', sans-serif;">President Mugabe is believed to have secured immunity from prosecution for himself and his family last week, but officials say they do not know if the offer still stands. On the streets of the capital, ordinary Zimbabweans tell The Independent he and Grace Mugabe must 'face the music'</h3>

	<p>Robert Mugabe announced his resignation as President of Zimbabwe, as parliament began impeachment proceedings to strip him of power and open the way for prosecution.
	</p>
	<p>
His departure, after a stand-off lasting days following a military coup, brings an end to the reign of a man who was Africaâ€™s longest-serving head of state, and one of the best known and controversial figures in international politics.
	</p>
	<p>
The announcement of the resignation came with the drama that has been one of the hallmarks of this extraordinary saga. The motion of impeachment was being debated by the National Assembly and the Senate, with speaker after speaker lining up to denounce the President, when the news came that he had gone.
	</p>
	<p>
There was a moment of silence when speaker Jacob Mudenda adjourned the debate and gave the reason why. Then there was pandemonium, with MPs and Senators clapping, shouting, cheering and hugging each other.
	</p>
	<p>
The noise inside the Harare International Conference Centre, where proceedings had been moved to accommodate the two houses of parliament, was soon matched and surpassed by roars from outside, followed by the noise of car horns and music.
